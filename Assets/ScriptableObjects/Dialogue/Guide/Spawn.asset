  - Welcome, Mr.Hero! I have many brothers and they will also be the guides throughout
    your journey!
  - Look for us, the bunnies and we have guides for you
  - First, talk to all the NPCs and learn to explore the maps
  - Follow the hints provided by the NPCs and free yourself!
  - By the way, here you need to collect something and pass through the transition
    to next map at the North side
  - Behind the lady, just walk onto it and you will see!
