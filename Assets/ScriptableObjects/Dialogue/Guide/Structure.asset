  - This is the Structure Town, up there is the Structure Campus!
  - Walk back from where you came from will go back to previous scene
  - Walk down the path, to the South will lead you to the Bonding scene!
  - 'The Girl from Village Scene must be asking you to look for information from
    me right? '
  - What I can tell you is Periodic Campus has all the Periodic Quizzes, complete
    them and she will let you pass...
