  - "[Graphite and Diamond]\n\n\u2022Diamond and graphite are allotropes of carbon
    which have giant covalent structures"
  - "\u2022Both substances contain only carbon atoms but due to the differences in
    bonding arrangements they are physically completely different\r\n\n\u2022Giant
    covalent structures contain billions of non-metal atoms, each joined to adjacent
    atoms by covalent bonds forming a giant lattice structure\r\n"
  - "[Diamond]\r\n\n\u2022In diamond, each carbon atom bonds with four other carbons,
    forming a tetrahedron\r\n\n\u2022All the covalent bonds are identical, very strong
    and there are no intermolecular forces\r\n"
  - '<sprite="diamond" index=0>

'
  - "[Graphite]\r\n\u2022Each carbon atom in graphite is bonded to three others forming
    layers of hexagons, leaving one free electron per carbon atom which becomes delocalised\r\n\n\u2022The
    covalent bonds within the layers are very strong, but the layers are attracted
    to each other by weak intermolecular forces\r\n"
  - '<sprite="graphite" index=0>

  - "[Properties of Diamond]\r\n\u2022Diamond has the following physical properties:\r\n\to
    It does not conduct electricity\r\n\to It has a very high melting point\r\n\to
    It is extremely hard and dense\r\n"
  - "\u2022All the outer shell electrons in carbon are held in the four covalent
    bonds around each carbon atom, so there are no freely moving charged particles
    to carry the current thus it cannot conduct electricity"
  - "\u2022The four covalent bonds are very strong and extend in a giant lattice,
    so a very large amount of heat energy is needed to break the lattice thus it
    has a very high melting point"
  - "\u2022Diamond \u0301s hardness makes it very useful for purposes where extremely
    tough material is required\r\n\n\u2022Diamond is used in jewellery due to its
    sparkly appearance and as cutting tools as it is such a hard material\r\n"
  - "\u2022The cutting edges of discs used to cut bricks and concrete are tipped
    with diamonds\r\n\n\u2022Heavy-duty drill bits and tooling equipment are also
    diamond-tipped\r\n"
  - "[Properties of Graphite]\r\n\n\u2022Each carbon atom is bonded to three others
    forming layers of hexagonal-shaped forms, leaving one free electron per carbon
    atom\r\n"
  - "\u2022These free (delocalised) electrons exist in between the layers and are
    free to move through the structure and carry charge, hence graphite can conduct
    electricity"
  - "\u2022The covalent bonds within the layers are very strong but the layers are
    connected to each other by weak forces only, hence the layers can slide over
    each other making graphite slippery and smooth"
  - "\u2022Graphite thus:\r\n\n\to Coducts electricity\r\n\to Has a very high melting
    point\r\n\to Is soft and slippery, less dense than diamond \r\n"
  - "\u2022Graphite is used in pencils and as an industrial lubricant, in engines
    and in locks\r\n\n\u2022It is also used to make non-reactive electrodes for electrolysis\r\n"
  - "[Silicon(IV) Oxide]\r\n\n\u2022Silicon(IV) oxide (also known as silicon dioxide
    or silica), SiO2, is a macromolecular compound which occurs naturally as sand
    and quartz\r\n"
  - "\u2022Each oxygen atom forms covalent bonds with 2 silicon atoms and each silicon
    atom in turn forms covalent bonds with 4 oxygen atoms\r\n\n\u2022A tetrahedron
    is formed with one silicon atom and four oxygen atoms, similar to diamond \r\n"
  - <sprite="SiliOx" index=0>
  - "[Metallic Bonding]\r\n\n\u2022Metal atoms are held together strongly by metallic
    bonding in a giant metallic lattice\r\n\n\u2022Within the metallic lattice, the
    atoms lose the electrons from their outer shell and become positively charged
    ions\r\n"
  - "\u2022The outer electrons no longer belong to a particular metal atom and are
    said to be delocalised\r\n\n\n\u2022They move freely between the positive metal
    ions like a 'sea of electrons'\r\n"
  - "\u2022Metallic bonds are strong and are a result of the attraction between the
    positive metal ions and the negatively charged delocalised electrons"
  - '<sprite="Metallic" index=0>

'
  - '[Properties of Metals]'
  - "\u2022Metals have high melting and boiling points\r\n\to There are many strong
    metallic bonds in giant metallic structures between the positive metal ion and
    delocalised electrons\r\n\to A lot of heat energy is needed to break these bonds\r\n"
  - "\u2022Metals conduct electricity\r\n\n\t- There are free electrons available
    to move through the structure and carry charge\r\n\t"
  - "\t-  Electrons entering one end of the metal cause a delocalised electron to
    displace itself from the other end\r\n\t\n\t-  Hence electrons can flow so electricity
    is conducted\r\n"
  - "\u2022Metals are malleable and ductile\r\n\t- Layers of positive ions can slide
    over one another and take up different positions\r\n\t-Metallic bonding is not
    disrupted as the outer electrons do not belong to any particular metal atom so
    the delocalised electrons will move with them\r\n"
  - '- Metallic bonds are thus not broken and as a result metals are strong but flexible


    -
    They can be hammered and bent into different shapes or drawn into wires without
    breaking
