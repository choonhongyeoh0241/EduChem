    atoms lose their outer electrons which the non-metal atoms gain to form positive
    and negative ions\r\n"
  - "\u2022The positive and negative ions are held together by strong electrostatic
    forces of attraction between opposite charges\r\n\n\n\u2022This force of attraction
    is known as an ionic bond, and they hold ionic compounds together\r\n"

    charge of the ion is spread evenly which is shown by using brackets\r\n\toThe

    to another atom to gain a full outer shell of electrons\r\n\n\u2022A positive
    sodium ion with the charge 1+ is formed\r\n"
  - "\u2022Chlorine is a Group VII non-metal so will need to gain an electron to
    have a full outer shell of electrons\r\n\n\u2022One electron will be transferred
    from the outer shell of the sodium atom to the outer shell of the chlorine atom\r\n"
  - "\u2022A chlorine atom will gain an electron to form a negatively charged chloride
    ion with a charge of 1-\r\n\n\u2022The oppositely charged ions are held together
    by strong electrostatic forces of attraction\r\n\n\u2022The ionic compound has
    no overall charge\r\n"

    or in solution \r\n\n\n\u2022They are poor conductors in the solid state\r\n"
