  - "[General properties]\r\n\u2022\tThey are very hard and strong metals and are
    good conductors of heat and electricity\r\n\u2022\tThey have very high melting
    points and are highly dense metals\r\n"
  - "\u2022\tFor example, the melting point of titanium is 1,688\xBAC whereas potassium
    in Group I melts at only 63.5\xBAC, slightly warmer than the average cup of hot
    chocolate!"
  - "\u2022\tThe transition elements form coloured compounds and often have more
    than one oxidation state, such as iron readily forming compounds of both Fe2+
    and Fe3+\r\n\u2022\tThese coloured compounds are responsible for the pigments
    in many paints and the colours of gemstones and rocks\r\n"
  - "\u2022\tTransition elements, as elements or in compounds, are often used as
    catalysts to improve the rate or reaction in industrial processes\n-->"
  - "o\tTransition element catalysts of platinum or rhodium are also used in car
    exhausts in the 'catalytic convertor' to reduce the levels of nitrous oxides
    and carbon monoxide produced"
  - '[Transition Elements Oxidation Numbers]

    -->'
  - "\u2022\tThe transition elements have more than one oxidation number, as they
    can lose a different number of electrons, depending on the chemical environment
    they are in"
  - "\u2022\tFor example. iron either:\r\no\tLose two electrons to form Fe2+ so has
    an oxidation number of +2\r\no\tLoses three electrons to form Fe3+ so has an
    oxidation number of +3\r\n"
  - "\u2022\tCompounds containing transition elements in different oxidation states
    will have different properties and colours"
