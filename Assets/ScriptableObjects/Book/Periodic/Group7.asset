  - "[Group 7 Basic Understanding]\r\n\u2022\tThe elements in Group 17 are Fluorine,
    Chlorine, Bromine, Iodine, and Astatine\r\n\u2022\tThese elements are known as
    halogens.\r\n"
  - "\u2022\tHalogen is a Greek word which means salt-former\u2019\r\n-  Halogens
    are reactive non-metals.\r\n-  They exist naturally in various mineral salts
    in our earth\u2019s crust and sea water.\r\n\u2022\tHalogens exist as diatomic
    covalent molecules: Molecular formulae \u2013\r\n- F2, Cl2, Br2, I2, At2\r\n"

  - "\u2022\tColours of the halogens become darker going down Group 17\r\n-\tFluorine
    \u2013 Pale yellow gas\r\n-\tChlorine \u2013 Greenish-yellow gas\r\n-\tBromine
    \u2013 Reddish-brown liquid\r\n-\tIodine \u2013 Purplish-black solid\r\n"
  - "\u2022\tAll halogens have low melting and boiling points\r\n-\tThe halogen molecules
    are held together by weak intermolecular forces. Hence, small amount of heat
    energy is needed to overcome it during melting or boiling.\r\n"
  - "\u2022\tAll halogens have low densities.\r\n\u2022\tAll halogens do not conduct
    electricity.\r\n\u2022\tAll halogens are weak conductors of heat.\r\n"
  - "[Physical Properties \u2013 Trend of change]"
  - "\u2022\tThe atomic radius (atomic size) of the halogens increases gradually
    down the group.\r\n-\tThe number of shells occupied with electrons increases
    down the group.\r\n\u2022\tAlthough halogens have low densities, the density
    of the halogens increases gradually down the group.\r\n"
  - "[Similar Chemical Properties]\n\n\u2022\tAll halogens exhibit similar chemical
    properties.\r\n-\tThis is because all the atoms of halogens have 7 outer shell.\r\n"
  - "[Reactivity]\r\n\u2022\tAlthough halogens exhibit similar chemical properties,
    they differ in reactivity.\r\n"
  - "\u2022\tThe reactivity of halogens decreases when going down Group 7.\r\n-\tAll
    halogens have seven outer shell. Each halogen atom will gain one electron to
    achieve a stable octet electron arrangement. Hence, an ion with a charge of -1
    is formed. "
  - 'When going down Group 7, the atomic size of halogens increases. The outermost
    occupied shell becomes further away from the nucleus and is screened by more
    inner shells containing electrons. '
  - 'This means that the effective nuclear charge exerted on the outer shell decreases
    when going down the group. '
  - Hence, the attractive forces exerted by the nucleus to attract one more electron
    into the outer shell decreases when going down the group. This causes the reactivity
    of halogens to decrease down the group.
  - "\u2022\tThe reactivity of a halogen is measured by how easily its atom accepts
    one electron to achieve a stable noble gas electron arrangement (octet electron
    arrangement).\r\n\u2022\tThe easier the atom of a halogen gains one electron,
    the more reactive is the halogen.\r\n"
  - '[Safety precautions when handling Group 7 elements]'
  - "\u2022\tFluorine is not only poisonous but also a very dangerous reactive gas,
    whereas astatine is radioactive. Therefore, these two elements are not used in
    school laboratories."
  - "\u2022\tChlorine gas, bromine gas and iodine vapour are poisonous.\r\n\u2022\tIodine
    vapour is harmful to the respiratory system of living things including human
    beings.\r\n"
  - "\u2022\tHence, chlorine, bromine and iodine should be handled in the correct
    ways in the laboratories."
  - "\u2022\tThe following safety precautions must be taken when handling these halogens.\r\n-\tHandle
    the halogens in a fume chamber.\r\n-\tWear safety goggles and gloves.\r\n"
