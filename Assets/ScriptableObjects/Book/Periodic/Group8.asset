  - "[Group 8 Basic Understanding]\r\n\u2022\tThe elements in Group 8 are Helium,
    Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon, and Radon\r\n\u2022\tThese elements are known as
    noble gases.\r\n"
  - "[Unreactive (Inert) properties of noble gases]\r\n\u2022\tEach helium atom has
    only 2 electrons in one filled electron shell.\r\nThis electron arrangement is
    known as the duplet electron arrangement.\r\n"
  - "\u2022\tThe outermost shells of the atoms of the other noble gases have 8 electrons.\r\nThis
    electron arrangement is known as the octet electron arrangement.\r\n\u2022\tThe
    duplet electron arrangement of helium and the octet electron arrangement of the
    other noble gases are very stable.\r\n"
  - "\u2022\tHence, atoms of noble gases do not release electrons, accept electrons
    or share electrons among each other or with atoms of other elements."
  - "\u2022\tThus, noble gases exist as monatomic molecules and do not react with
    the other elements or compounds. This means that noble gases are inert chemically
    or chemically unreactive."
