  - "[Group 1 Basic understanding]\r\n\n\u2022The Group I metals are also called
    the alkali metals as they form alkaline solutions with high pH values when reacted
    with water\r\n"
  - "\u2022Group I metals are lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and
    francium\r\n\n\n\u2022Common Characteristic - They all contain just one electron
    in their outer shell\r\n"
  - "[Group 1 General Physical Properties]\r\n\n\u2022Group 1 metals are soft and
    easy to cut, getting even softer and denser as you move down the Group (sodium
    and potassium do not follow the trend in density)\n\n\u2022Group 1 metals have
    shiny silvery surfaces when freshly cut"
  - "\u2022Group 1 metals conduct heat and electricity\r\n\n\u2022Group 1 metals
    have low melting points and low densities compared to other metals, and the melting
    point decreases as you move down the Group; some would melt on a hot day\r\n"
  - "\u2022Group 1 metals\u2019 surfaces turn dull when exposed to air because alkali
    metals are very reactive. They react rapidly with oxygen and water vapour in
    the air when exposed."
  - "[Group 1 Physical Properties \u2013 trend of change]"
  - "\u2022The atomic radius (atomic size) of alkali metals increases gradually down
    the group\r\n\n\t-The number of shells occupied with electrons increases down
    the group.\r\n\n"
  - "\u2022Although alkali metals have low melting and boiling points, the melting
    and boiling points decrease gradually down the group."
  - "\u2022Although alkali metals have low densities, the densities increase gradually
    down the group.\r\n\t-Lithium, sodium, and potassium are less dense than water.
    Thus, these metals float on the water surface.\r\n\t-Rubidium, caesium, and francium
    are denser than water. Thus, these metals sink in water.\r\n"
  - "\u2022Alkali metals become softer down the group.\r\n\r\n"
  - "[Group 1 Chemical Properties]\r\n\n\t[Similar Chemical Properties]\r\n\n\u2022All
    alkali metal exhibit similar chemical properties because all the atoms of alkali
    metals have one outer shell."
  - "\u2022Alkali metals are very reactive in a way of  differing in reactivity,
    the reactivity of alkali metals increases when going down Group 1."
  - "\u2022Group 1 elements exhibit similar chemical properties in their reactions
    with\r\n\t-water to liberate hydrogen gas and form metal hydroxide.\r\n\t-oxygen
    to produce metal oxides.\r\n\t-chlorine to produce metal chloride.\r\n\t-bromine
    to produce metal bromide.\r\n"
  - "[Reactivity]\n -->"
  - "\u2022The reactivity of an alkali metal is measured by how easily its atom loses
    its single outer shell electron to achieve a stable noble gas electron arrangement
    (duplet or octet electron arrangement). "
  - The easier an alkali metal atom releases its single outer shell, the more reactive
    is the alkali metal.
  - 'All alkali metals have one outer shell. Each atom of an alkali metal will release
    one outer shell during a chemical reaction to achieve a stable duplet or octet
    electron arrangement. Hence, an ion with a charge of+1 is formed. '
  - 'When going down Group 1, the atomic size of alkali metals increases. The single
    outer shell becomes further away from the nucleus and is screened by more inner
    shells containing electrons. This means that the effective nuclear charge felt
    by the single outer shell decreases when going down the group. '
  - 'This causes the attractive forces between the nucleus and the single outer shell
    become weaker, so the single outer shell is more weakly pulled by the nucleus. '
  - Hence, the single outer shell can be released more easily when going down the
    group. As a result, the reactivity of alkali metals increases down the group.
  - '[To predict the properties of rubidium, caesium, and francium]'
  - "\u2022\tRubidium, caesium, and francium are placed below potassium in Group
    1 of the Periodic Table."
  - "\u2022\tHence, rubidium, caesium and francium are expected to react with water,
    oxygen, chlorine, or bromine in a similar way as potassium, but these reactions
    are more vigorous (more reactive) than potassium."
  - <sprite="PeriodicEq" index=0>
  - "[Solubility]\r\n\u2022\tCarbonate, nitrate, chloride, sulphate, bromide, and
    iodide salts of alkali metals are white solids.\r\n\u2022\tThese salts are soluble
    in water. They dissolve in water to form colourless solutions.\r\n"
  - "[Safety precautions when handling Group 1 elements]\r\n\u2022\tAlkali metals
    are very reactive.\r\n\u2022\tAlkali metals, when exposed, can react with oxygen
    and water vapour in the air.\r\n"
  - "\u2022\tHence, alkali metals such as lithium, sodium and potassium must be kept
    in paraffin oil, whereas rubidium and caesium are stored in sealed glass tubes.
    This is to prevent them from reacting with oxygen and water vapour in the air."
  - "\u2022\tThe following safety precautions must be taken when handling alkali
    metals.\r\n-\tAvoid holding the highly reactive alkali metals with your bare
    hands.\r\n-\tWear safety goggles and gloves during an experiment.\r\n"
