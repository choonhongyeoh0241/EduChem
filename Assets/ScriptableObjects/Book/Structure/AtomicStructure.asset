    of protons and cannot be split into anything simpler\r\n\u2022There are 118 elements
    found in the Periodic Table\r\n"

    combined\r\n\u2022There is an unlimited number of compounds\r\n\u2022Compounds
    cannot be separated into their elements by physical means\r\n\u2022E.g., copper(II)

    called atoms which are the building blocks of all matter\r\n\n\u2022Each atom
    is made of subatomic particles called protons, neutrons, and electrons\r\n"
  - "\u2022The protons and neutrons are located at the centre of the atom, which
    is called the nucleus\r\n\n\u2022The electrons move very fast around the nucleus
    in orbital paths called shells\r\n\n\u2022The mass of the electron is negligible;
    hence the mass of an atom is contained within the nucleus where the protons and
    neutrons are located\r\n"

  - "[Subatomic Particles]\r\n\n\u2022The size of atoms is so tiny that we can't
    really compare their masses in conventional units such as kilograms or grams,
    so a unit called the relative atomic mass is used\r\n\n\u2022One relative atomic
    mass unit is equal to 1/12th the mass of a carbon-12 atom.\r\n\n\u2022All other
    elements are measured relative to the mass of a carbon-12 atom, so relative atomic
    mass has no units \r\n"
  - "\u2022Hydrogen for example has a relative atomic mass of 1, meaning that 12
    atoms of hydrogen would have exactly the same mass as 1 atom of carbon\r\n\n\n\u2022The

    of protons in the nucleus of an atom\r\n\n\u2022The symbol for atomic number
    is Z\r\n\n\u2022It is also the number of electrons present in a neutral atom
    and determines the position of the element on the Periodic Table\r\n"
  - "[Mass Number]\r\n\n\u2022The Nucleon number (or mass number) is the total number
    of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom\r\n\n\u2022The symbol for nucleon
    number is A\r\n\n\u2022The nucleon number minus the proton number gives you the
    number of neutrons of an atom\r\n"
  - "\u2022Note that protons and neutrons can collectively be called nucleons.\r\n\n\u2022The
    atomic number and mass number of an element can be shown using atomic notation\r\n\n\u2022The
    Periodic Table shows the elements together with their atomic (proton) number
    at the top and relative atomic mass at the bottom - there is a difference between
    relative atomic mass and mass number, but for your exam, you can use the relative
    atomic mass as the mass number (with the exception of chlorine)\r\n"
