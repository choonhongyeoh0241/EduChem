    We can represent the structure of the atom
    in two ways: using diagrams called electron shell diagrams or by writing out
    a special notation called the electronic configuration (or electronic structure)

'
  - "[Electron Shell Diagrams]\r\n\n\u2022Electrons orbit the nucleus in shells (or
    energy levels) and each shell has a different amount of energy associated with
    it\r\n\n\n"
  - "\u2022The further away from the nucleus, the more energy a shell has\r\n\n\u2022Electrons
    fill the shell closest to the nucleus \r"
  - "\u2022When a shell becomes full of electrons, additional electrons have to be
    added to the next shell\r\n\n\u2022The first shell can hold 2 electrons\r\n\n"
  - "\u2022The second shell can hold 8 electrons \r\n\n\u2022The outermost shell
    of an atom is called the outer shell and an atom is much more stable if it can
    manage to completely fill this shell with electrons \r\n"

  - "[Writing electronic configuration]\r\n\n\u2022The arrangement of electrons in
    shells can also be explained using numbers\r\n\n\u2022Instead of drawing electron
    shell diagrams, the number of electrons in each electron shell can be written
    down, separated by commas\r\n\n"
  - "\u2022This notation is called the electronic configuration (or electronic structure)\r\n\t-E.g.,
    Carbon has 6 electrons, 2 in the 1st shell and 4 in the 2nd shell\r\n"
  - "\u2022Its electronic configuration is 2,4\r\n\n\u2022Electronic configurations
    can also be written for ions\r\n\t\n"
  - "-E.g., A sodium atom has 11 electrons, a sodium ion has lost one electron, therefore
    has 10 electrons: 2 in the first shell and 8 in the 2nd shell\r\n\n\u2022Its
    electronic configuration is 2,8\r"
  - '[Relationship between Electron Shells and Periodic Table]'
  - '-There is a clear relationship between the electronic configuration and how
    the Periodic Table is designed



'
  - '-The number of notations in the electronic configuration will show the number
    of occupied shells of electrons the atom has, showing the period in which, that
    element is in

'
  - "-The last notation shows the number of outer electrons the atom has, showing
    the group that element is in (for elements in Groups I to VII)\r\n\n\n-Elements
    in the same group have the same number of outer shell electrons \r\n"
