  - "[Isotopes]\r\n\n\u2022Isotopes are different atoms of the same element that
    contain the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons\r\n\n\u2022The
    symbol for an isotope is the chemical symbol (or word) followed by a dash and
    then the mass number\r\n\n\u2022C-14 ( or carbon-14) is the isotope of carbon
    which contains 6 protons, 6 electrons and 14 - 6 = 8 neutrons\r\n\t-It can also
    be written as 14C or  \r\n"

  - '[Why Isotopes share properties?]'
  - "\u2022Isotopes of the same element display the same chemical characteristics\r\n\n\n\u2022This
    is because they have the same number of electrons in their outer shells and,
    therefore, the same electronic configuration and this is what determines an atom's
    chemistry\r\n"
  - "\u2022The difference between isotopes is the number of neutrons which are neutral
    particles within the nucleus and add mass only\r\n\n\u2022The difference in mass
    affects the physical properties, such as density, boiling point and melting point\r\n\n\u2022Isotopes
    are identical in appearance, so a sample of C-14 would look no different from
    C-12\r\n"
  - "\u2022Water made from deuterium oxide is known as 'heavy' water, and has a relative
    formula of mass 20, compared to 18 for water, so it is 20% heavier, but it would
    look, taste, and feel just like normal water\r\n\t-However, it wouldn't be a
    good idea to drink it because it is toxic as it interferes with biochemical reactions
    in your cells\r\n"
  - '[Calculating Relative Atomic Mass]'
  - "\u2022The symbol for the relative atomic mass is Ar\r\n\n\u2022The relative
    atomic mass for each element can be found in the Periodic Table along with the
    atomic number\r\n\n\u2022The atomic number is shown above the atomic symbol and
    the relative atomic mass is shown below the atomic symbol\r\n"
  - "\u2022Atoms are too small to accurately weigh but scientists needed a way to
    compare the masses of atoms \r\n\n\u2022The carbon-12 is used as the standard
    atom and has a fixed mass of 12 units \r\n\n\u2022It is against this atom which
    the masses of all other atoms are compared \r\n"
  - "\u2022Relative atomic mass (Ar) can therefore be defined as:\r\n\t-the average
    mass of the isotopes of an element compared to 1/12th of the mass of an atom
    of 12C \r\n"
  - "\u2022The relative atomic mass of carbon is 12\r\n\t-The relative atomic mass
    of magnesium is 24 which means that magnesium is twice as heavy as carbon \r\n\t-The
    relative atomic mass of hydrogen is 1 which means it has one-twelfth the mass
    of one carbon-12 atom \r\n"
  - "\u2022The relative atomic mass of an element can be calculated from the mass
    number and relative abundances of all the isotopes of a particular element using
    the following equation\n\n-->"

  - "\u2022On the Periodic Table provided in your exam you will see that lithium
    has a relative atomic mass of 7\r\n\n\n\u2022Although it seems that this is the
    same as the mass number, they are not the same thing because the relative atomic
    mass is a rounded number\r\n"
  - "\u2022Relative atomic mass takes into account the existence of isotopes when
    calculating the mass\r\n\n\u2022Relative atomic mass is an average mass of all
    the isotopes of that element\r\n\n\u2022For simplicity relative atomic masses
    are often shown to the nearest whole number\r\n"
