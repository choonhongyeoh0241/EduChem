  - "\u2022Requires heat energy which transforms into kinetic energy, allowing the
    particles to move\r\n\n\u2022Occurs at a specific temperature known as the melting
    point (m.p.) \r"
  - "[Boiling]\n\n\u2022Boiling is when a liquid changes into a gas\r\n\n"
  - "\u2022Requires heat which causes bubbles of gas to form below the surface of
    a liquid, allowing for liquid particles to escape from the surface and within
    the liquid\r\n\n\u2022Occurs at a specific temperature known as the boiling point
    (b.p.)\r"
  - "[Freezing]\n\n\u2022Freezing is when a liquid changes into a solid\r\n\n"
  - "\u2022This is the reverse of melting and occurs at exactly the same temperature
    as melting, hence the melting point and freezing point of a pure substance are
    the same. Water, for example, freezes and melts at 0 \xBAC\r\n\n"
  - "\u2022Requires a significant decrease in temperature (or loss of thermal energy)
    and occurs at a specific temperature \r"
  - "[Evaporation]\n\n\u2022Evaporation occurs when a liquid changes into a gas and
    occurs over a range of temperatures\r\n quickly a liquid can evaporate\r\n"
  - "\u2022Evaporation occurs only at the surface of liquids where high energy particles
    can escape from the liquid's surface at low temperatures, below the b.p. of the
    liquid\r\n\n\u2022The larger the surface area and the warmer the liquid surface,
    the more"
  - "[Condensation]\n\n\u2022Condensation occurs when a gas changes into a liquid
    on cooling and it takes place over a range of temperatures\r\n"
  - "\n\u2022When a gas is cooled its particles lose energy and when they bump into
    each other they lack the energy to bounce away again, instead they group together
    to form a liquid\r\n"
