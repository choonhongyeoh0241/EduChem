  - According to Kinetic Theory, there are three types of states
  - "First State: Solids\n\n\n\u2022Solids have a fixed volume and shape, and they
    have a high density\r\n\u2022The atoms vibrate in position but can\u2019t change
    location\r\n\u2022The particles are packed very closely together in a fixed and
    regular pattern\r\n"
  - "Second State: Liquids\n\n\u2022Liquids also have a fixed volume but adopt the
    shape of the container\r\n\u2022They are generally less dense than solids (an
    exception is water), but much denser than gases\r\n\u2022The particles move and
    slide past each other which is why liquids adopt the shape of the container and
    also why they are able to flow freely\r\n"
  - "Third State: Gases\n\n\u2022Gases do not have a fixed volume, and, like liquids,
    take up the shape of the container\r\n\u2022Gases have a very low density\r\n\u2022Since
    there is a lot of space between the particles, gases can be compressed into a
    much smaller volume\r\n\u2022The particles are far apart and move randomly and
    quickly (around 500 m/s) in all directions\r\n\u2022They collide with each other
    and with the sides of the container (this is how pressure is created inside a
    can of gas)\r\n"
