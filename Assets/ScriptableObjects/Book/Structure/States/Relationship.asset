  - "{Extended} \n[Relationship between state changes and kinetic theory]"
  - "\u2022When substances are heated, the particles absorb thermal energy which
    is converted into kinetic energy. This is the basis of the kinetic theory of
    matter\r\n\n\n"
  - "\u2022Heating a solid causes its particles to vibrate more and as the temperature
    increases, they vibrate so much that the solid expands until the structure breaks
    and the solid melts\r\n"
  - "\u2022On further heating, the now liquid substance expands more and some particles
    at the surface gain sufficient energy to overcome the intermolecular forces and
    evaporate\r\n\n\n"
  - "\u2022When the b.p. temperature is reached, all the particles gain enough energy
    to escape and the liquids boils\r\n"
  - "\u2022These changes in state can be shown on a graph called a heating curve\r\n\n\n\u2022Cooling
    down a gas has the reverse effect, and this would be called a cooling curve\r\n\n\n\u2022These
    curves are used to show how changes in temperature affect changes of state\r\n"
