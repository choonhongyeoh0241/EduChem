  - "\u2022Diffusion occurs much faster in gases than in liquids as gaseous particles
    move much quicker than liquid particles\r\n\n\n\u2022At the same temperature,
    different gases do not diffuse at the same rate.\r\n"
  - "\u2022This is due to the difference in their relative molecular masses\r\n\n\n\u2022Lighter
    gas particles can travel faster and hence further, therefore the lower its relative
    mass the faster a gas will diffuse\r\n"
  - "\u2022This can be demonstrated in the reaction between ammonia, NH3, and hydrogen
    chloride gas, HCl, inside a long glass tube\r\n\u2022Where the two gases meet
    a white smoke of ammonium chloride, NH4Cl, is formed\r\n\u2022This does not occur
    in the middle of the tube as you might expect, but much closer to the end with
    the hydrogen chloride (Mr = 36.5) and the ammonia (Mr = 17) molecules are smaller
    and lighter\r\n"

  - '[Why?]'
  - NH3 molecules have less mass than the HCl molecule, so diffuse faster, hence
    the product (a white smoke of NH4Cl) forms closer to the end where the HCl is
